# Slushy - fully typed and validated APIs üç¶üç≠

Slushy uses OAS (OpenApi Specification) schemas to generate server boilerplate and validate server inputs and outputs.
Slushy currently consist of the following parts:

-   [@slushy/codegen](./codegen) Takes an OAS schema and generates typescript type definitions as well as @slushy/server boilerplate.
-   [@slushy/server](./server) An opinionated NodeJS server based on an OAS schema with inputs/outputs validation and out of the box functionality such as api documentation.

To use slushy just follow three simple steps:

-   Define the OAS schema
-   Generate typescript types and server boilerplate
-   Run the server

Current features:

-   Input validation
-   Type generation
-   Route generation

## How does it work

**First**: Define your OAS Schema ‚úíÔ∏è

It's just like swagger. The following example defines one route `/pets` that will return an Array of Pets.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0

paths:
    # This will define the resource 'PetsResource'
    /pets:
        get:
            # This is required right now
            operationId: getPets
            responses:
                '200':
                    description: A lot of pets
                    content:
                        application/json:
                            schema:
                                type: array
                                items:
                                    $ref: '#/components/schemas/pet'
components:
    schemas:
        # This will define the type 'Pet'
        pet:
            type: object
            properties:
                id:
                    type: number
                name:
                    type: string
            required: ['id', 'name']
            additionalProperties: false
```

**Then**: Generate code using `yarn gen <schemaFile> <outputDir>` üé©

This will generate the following:

-   A `dir/types.ts` file, that contains all objects (e.g. `Pet`). These are types you can use to implement you code.
-   Multiple resource type stubs in `dir/resources`, e.g. `PetResource`. These are controller interface you have to implement.
-   A ResourceDefinition that you have to pass to `Slushy`, which will bind the OAS paths to your controllers.

Pet (generated):

```ts
export type Pet = {
    id: number
    name: string
}
```

PetsResource (generated):

```ts
export type GetPetsParams = {}

export type GetPetsResponse = Array<Pet>

// You have to implement this
export interface PetsResource<TContext> {
    getPets(params: GetPetsParams, context: SlushyContext<TContext>): Promise<GetPetsResponse>
}
```

</details>

**Last**: Setup the server

It's easy:

```ts
async function run() {
    const slushy = await Slushy.create({
        resourceConfiguration: new ResourceConfig({
            PetsResource: new PetsResourceImpl(),
        }),
    })
    await slushy.start(3031)
}

run()
```

# TODO

-   [ ] Create/use response types
-   [ ] Validate output
-   [ ] Use input/output formats
-   [ ] Handle dates
-   [ ] Add security, like helmet etc.
-   [ ] Implement authentication
